          <i> Anorexia nervosa </i>, commonly referred to as anorexia, is a
          serious and potentionally life-threatening mental health disorder
          characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted
          body image. This leads individuals to restrict their food instake
          drastically, often resulting in severe weight loss and malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left">
          Anorexia is more than just an extreme form of dieting; it is a complex
          condition influenced by biological, psychological, and enviormental
          factors. People with anorexia may also engage in excessive exercise,
          misuse laxatives, or other methods to lose weight.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left">
          This disorder affects people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds,
          thought it is most commonly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left">
          If left untreated, anorexia can have devastating effects on physical
          and mental health, including heart issues, bone density loss, organ
          failure, and severe depression. However, recovery is possible with
          early intervention, therapy, and a strong support network.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left">
          Understanding and spreading awareness about anorexia is crucial to
          breaking the stigma, encouraging those affected to seek help, and
          fostering a culture of empathy and support.
