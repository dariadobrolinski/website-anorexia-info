             <i> Anorexia nervosa </i>, commonly referred to as anorexia, is a serious and potentionally life-threatening 
             mental health disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image.
             This leads individuals to restrict their food instake drastically, often resulting in severe weight 
             loss and malnutrition.
          </p>
          <p style = "font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left;">
             Anorexia is more than just an extreme form of dieting; it is a complex condition influenced by 
             biological, psychological, and enviormental factors. People with anorexia may also engage in excessive 
             exercise, misuse laxatives, or other methods to lose weight. 
          </p>
          <p style = "font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left;">
             This disorder affects people of all genders, ages, and backgrounds, thought it is most commonly diagnosed
             in adolescents and young adults.
          </p>
          <p style = "font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left;">
             If left untreated, anorexia can have devastating effects on physical and mental health, including heart 
             issues, bone density loss, organ failure, and severe depression. However, recovery
             is possible with early intervention, therapy, and a strong support network.
          </p>
          <p style = "font-size: 25px; text-indent: 25px; text-align: left;">
             Understanding and spreading awareness about anorexia is crucial to breaking the stigma, 
             encouraging those affected to seek help, and fostering a culture of empathy and support.
