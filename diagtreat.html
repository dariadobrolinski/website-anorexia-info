            Diagnosing anorexia nervosa typically involves a comprehensive assesssment by a healthcare professional, 
            such as a doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist. The evaluation includes:
        </p>
        <ul class = "space">
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Medical History: </strong> Health care providers review the individual's eating habits, weight history, 
                and any physical symptoms. 
            </li>
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Physical Exam: </strong> Health care providers do a physical examination, sometimes including blood work 
                to check for signs of malnutrition, including low weight, irregular heart rate, or other physical complications. 
                Health care providers also typically run physical examinations to check for other medical conditions that may be causing 
                the eating issues.
            </li>
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Psychological Assessment: </strong> Anorexia is not diagnosed based on a physical examination, psychological 
                assessments are crucial to diagnosis. Health care providers ask a series of questions related to the individual's feelings, 
                thoughts, eating habits, and behaviors. These questions may be personal but it is important to answer honestly so the health 
                care provider can provide an accurate diagnosis and establish a treatment plan. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class = "bigspace">
            It's important to note that anorexia can affect individuals of any body size, and being underweight is not required for a 
            diagnosis. Early diagnosis is critical to prevent long-term health complications. 
        </p>

            <span style = "font-size: 45px; font-weight:bold"> Treatment </span>
        </h2>
        <p class = "space">
            Treating anorexia involves a multidisciplinary approach to address the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects 
            of the disorder. A team approach is best, including doctors, mental health professionals and other healthcare professionals.
            Here is what is commonly involved in treatment. 
        </p>
        <ul class = "space">
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Medical Stabilization: </strong> For those experiencing severe health complications, hospitalization may be necessary 
                to stablize vital signs and address malnutrition. 
            </li>
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Other Programs: </strong> There are many clinics that specialize in treating eating disorders. Many offer day treatment programs or 
                residential treatment programs rather than a hospital stay. 
                  <ul>
                    <li class = "doubspace">
                        <strong> Residential: </strong> Residential treatment requires the individual to stay at a facility where they recieve 24-hour care. 
                    </li>
                    <li class = "sspace">
                        <strong> Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): </strong> PHP provides day long treatment for individuals that do not require 24-hour 
                        care and supervision. Though PHP is a step down from residential, it is still a highly structured treatment enviroment. Often, PHP is 
                        Monday - Friday from the morning into the afternoon (eg. my PHP was roughly 6 hours a day, 9:00am - 2:30pm).
                    </li>
                    <li class = "sspace">
                        <strong> Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP): </strong> IOP provides support for those who need more care than weekly outpatient appointments 
                        but don't require PHP or residential level of care. Often, IOP meets 3-5 days a week for 2-3 hours.

            </li>
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Therapy:</strong> There are many therapies used to treat anorexia, here are the most common:
                <ul>
                    <li class = "ssspace">
                        <strong> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): </strong> CBT is a form of talk therapy (psychotherapy) that can helps individuals become 
                        aware of negative thinking patterns or behaviors and helps develop healthier ways of thinking and coping. It emphasizes breaking the cycle 
                        of harmful behaviors and replacing them with more constructive habits. 
                    </li>
                    <li class = "sspace">
                        <strong> Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT): </strong> DBT is another form of talk therapy designed to help individuals manage intense 
                        emotions and develop skills for improving relationships and coping with emotions. DBT teaches skills in four main catagories: mindfulness, 
                        emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. 
                    </li>
                    <li class = "sspace">
                        <strong> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): </strong> ACT is a mindfulness-based therapy that focuses on accepting difficult thoughts 
                        and emotions rather than fighting them, while commiting to behaviors that align with one's values. For anorexia, ACT encourages individuals 
                        to stop avoiding uncomfortable feelings about food or body image and instead work toward meaningful goals, such as improving health and compassion. 
                    </li>
                    <li class = "sspace">
                        <strong> Family-Based Therapy (FBT): </strong> FBT, also known as the Maudsley Method, is an evidence-based approach for treating eating disorders 
                        in adolescents. It involves parents or guardians taking an active role in ensuring the adolescent eats properly and restores weight (if necessary). 
                        Over time, the responsibility for managing food and eating is gradually returned to the adolescent as their health stabilizes. FBT also focuses 
                        on repairing family relationships and creating a supportive enviroment for recovery. 
                    </li>
                    <li class = "sspace">
                        <strong> Exposure Therapy: </strong> Exposure therapy is a behavioral therapy technique that helps individuals confront and reduce fear or anxiety 
                        associated with certain situations. For anorexia this may look like: gradually re-introducing fear foods, eating in social settings, or 
                        challenging rituals around eating. By repeatedly facing these fears in a controlled enviroment, individuals can reduce their anxiety and 
                        develop healthier behaviors. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class = "space">
                <strong> Medications: </strong> Although there is no medication specifically for anorexia, antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed 
                to adress related mental health conditions. 
            </li>
