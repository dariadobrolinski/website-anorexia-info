            Anorexia is just about wanting to be thin.

                Anorexia is not soley about appearance of weight. It's a complex mental health disorder often rooted in 
                a need for control, perfectionism, trauma, or low self-esteem. It involves emotional and psychological 
                struggles, not just physical ones.

               People with anorexia just need to "eat more" 
              <ul>

                  <span style = "font-size: 35px; color: #48c9b0; font-weight: bold;"> TRUTH: </span>
                  Recovery involves adressing the underlying emotional, psychological, and behavioral issues throught therapy, 
                  medical treatment, and support systems. Simply eating more doesn't resolve the mental health aspects of anorexia.

                    Anorexia affects people of all ages, genders, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds. While it is more commonly diagnosed 
                    in women, men and nonbinary people can also struggle with anorexia. Older adults and children are not immune to anorexia 
                    either.

                    Once someone gains weight, they're "cured" 
                  <ul>

                      Weight restoration is a step of recovery, but it does not address the psychologial components of anorexia. 
                      Long-term recovery involves ongoing therapy and support to address distorted thoughts and prevent relapse.

                    Anorexia is just a phase or attention-seeking. 
                    <ul>

                        Anorexia is a not a choice or a cry for attention; it's a serious and potentionally life-threatening 
                        mental illness. Many individuals suffer in silence - trying to hide their struggles. Many feel an 
                        immense shame about their behaviors.

                    If someone eats, they can't have anoreixa.

                        People with anorexia may eat small amounts, restrict certain food groups, or eat in a controlled manner. 
                        It's the extreme fear of weight gain and obsessive thoughts about food that define the disorder, not the 
                        complete absence of eating.  
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    You can tell if someone has anorexia by looking at them / all people with anorexia are underweight.
                    <ul>
                      <li class = "bigspace">
                        <span style = "font-size: 35px; color: #48c9b0; font-weight: bold;"> TRUTH: </span>
                        Not all individuals with anorexia appear visibily ill or underweight. The mental health illness is about 
                        behaviors and thought patterns, which are not always reflected in someone's appearance.
