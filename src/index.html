                Anorexia Nervosa is a serious eating disorder characterized by an 
                intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, leading 
                individuals to restrict their food intake severely. It is not just 
                about food but is often linked to deep psychological struggles, 
                including anxiety and perfectionism.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in-bottom">
            People with anorexia may engage in extreme dieting, excessive exercise, 
            or other behaviors to control their weight. This disorder can have 
            devastating physical and mental health consequences, affecting the 
            heart, bones, and overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in-bottom">
            Despite common misconceptions, anorexia is not a choice. It is a 
            complex mental health condition that requires compassion, understanding, 
            and proper medical and psychological support.

            <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                My name is Daria Dobrolinski and I have been in anorexia recovery for 5 years.
              </p>
              <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  Growing up, I was the kid who loved food. My family
                  and friends would always tease me—lovingly—
                 about how much I could eat and how I seemed to
                  savor every bite. Food wasn’t just fuel; it was joy,
                  connection, and comfort. But something changed
                  when I turned 12. Almost overnight, I began feeling
                  like my body wasn’t good enough. There was a creeping voice in my
                  head telling me I needed to change. 
              </p>
              <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  I started dieting, cutting out foods I once loved, and
                  exercising obsessively. At first, it felt empowering, 
                 like I was in control. But no diet satisfied me, no 
                 amount of exercise felt like enough. Soon, I wasn’t 
                 eating much at all. What started as “self-
                 improvement” turned into a full-blown war against 
                 my own body. Months passed, and my world 
                 became smaller—calories, scales, and mirrors
                  consumed me. By the time I was 13, my parents
                  started to notice. I remember the car ride to the
                  doctor’s office like it was yesterday—screaming,
                  crying, swearing that I was fine. But I wasn’t.
                </p>
                <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  When the doctor said the words “anorexia 
                  nervosa,” my parents’ faces broke. I’ll never forget 
                  the disbelief in their eyes or the way my dad quietly
                   reached for my mom’s hand. They admitted me to 
                  a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) almost
                   immediately. At 13, I spent two months of my 
                  seventh-grade year in treatment, missing over 50 
                  days of school. But I wasn’t ready. I went through
                   the motions, eating just enough to get out. I didn’t 
                  want to get better—I just wanted out.
                </p>
                <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  For a while, I pretended I was better. But pretending 
                  wasn’t enough. I fell back into restriction, harder 
                  and faster than before. By 14, just two months into
                   my freshman year of high school, my mom dragged me back to 
                  the doctor. This time, they did an EKG, and the 
                  doctor told me something that made my stomach
                  drop: my heart rate was dangerously low, like that 
                  of someone in a coma. Hearing those words, 
                  flipped a switch in me. 
                  <strong> I knew I had to fight for my life.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  A few days later, I 
                  was back in PHP. But this time was different. I 
                  wanted recovery, even if the voices in my head 
                  didn’t. I was scared, but I also knew I couldn’t keep 
                  living like this. I woke up every day battling those 
                  voices, sometimes losing, sometimes winning. A
                  week into treatment, I went to my clinician and
                  said something she didn’t expect: “I want to go to
                  residential.”
                </p>
                <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  Residential was the hardest three weeks of my life. I 
                  cried almost every day, missing home, missing my 
                  family, missing the comfort of familiarity. On the 
                  third night, I begged my mom over the phone to 
                  take me home, promising I’d get better on my own.
                  She refused, and deep down, I knew she was right.
                  I had to stay and fight. Over those three weeks, I 
                  went from eating 25% of my meals to 100%. I 
                  started speaking in groups, opening up, and facing 
                  the pain I’d been trying to starve away. On 
                  February 11th, 2020, I was discharged.
                </p>
                <p class="fade-in-bottom">
                  Recovery hasn’t been easy, but it’s been worth it. 
                  Every day since then, I’ve chosen life. I’ve chosen 
                  freedom. Over the past five years in active 
                  recovery, I’ve rebuilt a relationship with food, my 
                  body, and myself. I’ve learned that I am so much 
                  more than a number on a scale or the size of my 
                  jeans. I’ve discovered strength I didn’t know I had 
                  and joy I thought I’d lost forever. Recovery is a 
                  choice I make every single day, and it’s the most 
                  important decision I’ll ever make. 
                  <strong>
                  Life after anorexia isn’t just surviving—it’s thriving.

                    <strong> Physical Exam: </strong> Health care providers do a physical examination, sometimes including blood work 
                    to check for signs of malnutrition, including low weight, irregular heart rate, or other physical complications. 
                    Health care providers also typically run physical examinations to check for other medical conditions that may be causing 
                    the eating issues.
                </li>
                <li >
                    <strong> Psychological Assessment: </strong> Anorexia is not diagnosed based on a physical examination, psychological 
                    assessments are crucial to diagnosis. Health care providers ask a series of questions related to the individual's feelings, 
                    thoughts, eating habits, and behaviors. These questions may be personal but it is important to answer honestly so the health 
                    care provider can provide an accurate diagnosis and establish a treatment plan. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's important to note that anorexia can affect individuals of any body size, and being underweight is not required for a 
                diagnosis. Early diagnosis is critical to prevent long-term health complications.

            <h1>Treatment</h1>
            <p >
                Treating anorexia involves a multidisciplinary approach to address the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects 
                of the disorder. A team approach is best, including doctors, mental health professionals and other healthcare professionals.
                Here is what is commonly involved in treatment. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Medical Stabilization: </strong> For those experiencing severe health complications, hospitalization may be necessary 
                    to stablize vital signs and address malnutrition. 
                </li>
                <li >
                    <strong> Other Programs: </strong> There are many clinics that specialize in treating eating disorders. Many offer day treatment programs or 
                    residential treatment programs rather than a hospital stay. 
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Residential: </strong> Residential treatment requires the individual to stay at a facility where they recieve 24-hour care. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP): </strong> PHP provides day long treatment for individuals that do not require 24-hour 
                            care and supervision. Though PHP is a step down from residential, it is still a highly structured treatment enviroment. Often, PHP is 
                            Monday - Friday from the morning into the afternoon (eg. my PHP was roughly 6 hours a day, 9:00am - 2:30pm).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP): </strong> IOP provides support for those who need more care than weekly outpatient appointments 
                            but don't require PHP or residential level of care. Often, IOP meets 3-5 days a week for 2-3 hours. 
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                </li>
                <li >
                    <strong> Therapy:</strong> There are many therapies used to treat anorexia, here are the most common:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): </strong> CBT is a form of talk therapy (psychotherapy) that can helps individuals become 
                            aware of negative thinking patterns or behaviors and helps develop healthier ways of thinking and coping. It emphasizes breaking the cycle 
                            of harmful behaviors and replacing them with more constructive habits. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT): </strong> DBT is another form of talk therapy designed to help individuals manage intense 
                            emotions and develop skills for improving relationships and coping with emotions. DBT teaches skills in four main catagories: mindfulness, 
                            emotional regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): </strong> ACT is a mindfulness-based therapy that focuses on accepting difficult thoughts 
                            and emotions rather than fighting them, while commiting to behaviors that align with one's values. For anorexia, ACT encourages individuals 
                            to stop avoiding uncomfortable feelings about food or body image and instead work toward meaningful goals, such as improving health and compassion. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Family-Based Therapy (FBT): </strong> FBT, also known as the Maudsley Method, is an evidence-based approach for treating eating disorders 
                            in adolescents. It involves parents or guardians taking an active role in ensuring the adolescent eats properly and restores weight (if necessary). 
                            Over time, the responsibility for managing food and eating is gradually returned to the adolescent as their health stabilizes. FBT also focuses 
                            on repairing family relationships and creating a supportive enviroment for recovery. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong> Exposure Therapy: </strong> Exposure therapy is a behavioral therapy technique that helps individuals confront and reduce fear or anxiety 
                            associated with certain situations. For anorexia this may look like: gradually re-introducing fear foods, eating in social settings, or 
                            challenging rituals around eating. By repeatedly facing these fears in a controlled enviroment, individuals can reduce their anxiety and 
                            develop healthier behaviors. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li >
                    <strong> Medications: </strong> Although there is no medication specifically for anorexia, antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed 
                    to adress related mental health conditions. 
                </li>
                <li >
