      My name is Daria Dobrolinski and I have been in anorexia recovery for 5 years.
    </p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
        Growing up, I was the kid who loved food. My family
        and friends would always tease me—lovingly—
       about how much I could eat and how I seemed to
        savor every bite. Food wasn’t just fuel; it was joy,
        connection, and comfort. But something changed
        when I turned 12. Almost overnight, I began feeling
        like my body wasn’t good enough. There was a creeping voice in my
        head telling me I needed to change. 
    </p>
    <p style = "text-indent: 25px">
        I started dieting, cutting out foods I once loved, and
        exercising obsessively. At first, it felt empowering, 
       like I was in control. But no diet satisfied me, no 
       amount of exercise felt like enough. Soon, I wasn’t 
       eating much at all. What started as “self-
       improvement” turned into a full-blown war against 
       my own body. Months passed, and my world 
       became smaller—calories, scales, and mirrors
        consumed me. By the time I was 13, my parents
        started to notice. I remember the car ride to the
        doctor’s office like it was yesterday—screaming,
        crying, swearing that I was fine. But I wasn’t.
      </p>
      <p style = "text-indent: 25px">
        When the doctor said the words “anorexia 
        nervosa,” my parents’ faces broke. I’ll never forget 
        the disbelief in their eyes or the way my dad quietly
         reached for my mom’s hand. They admitted me to 
        a Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) almost
         immediately. At 13, I spent two months of my 
        seventh-grade year in treatment, missing over 50 
        days of school. But I wasn’t ready. I went through
         the motions, eating just enough to get out. I didn’t 
        want to get better—I just wanted out.
      </p>
      <p style = "text-indent: 25px">
        For a while, I pretended I was better. But pretending 
        wasn’t enough. I fell back into restriction, harder 
        and faster than before. By 14, just two months into
         my freshman year of high school, my mom dragged me back to 
        the doctor. This time, they did an EKG, and the 
        doctor told me something that made my stomach
        drop: my heart rate was dangerously low, like that 
        of someone in a coma. Hearing those words, 
        flipped a switch in me. 
        <strong> I knew I had to fight for my life.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style = "text-indent: 25px">
        A few days later, I 
        was back in PHP. But this time was different. I 
        wanted recovery, even if the voices in my head 
        didn’t. I was scared, but I also knew I couldn’t keep 
        living like this. I woke up every day battling those 
        voices, sometimes losing, sometimes winning. A
        week into treatment, I went to my clinician and
        said something she didn’t expect: “I want to go to
        residential.”
      </p>
      <p style = "text-indent: 25px">
        Residential was the hardest three weeks of my life. I 
        cried almost every day, missing home, missing my 
        family, missing the comfort of familiarity. On the 
        third night, I begged my mom over the phone to 
        take me home, promising I’d get better on my own.
        She refused, and deep down, I knew she was right.
        I had to stay and fight. Over those three weeks, I 
        went from eating 25% of my meals to 100%. I 
        started speaking in groups, opening up, and facing 
        the pain I’d been trying to starve away. On 
        February 11th, 2020, I was discharged.
      </p>
      <p style = "text-indent: 25px">
        Recovery hasn’t been easy, but it’s been worth it. 
        Every day since then, I’ve chosen life. I’ve chosen 
        freedom. Over the past five years in active 
        recovery, I’ve rebuilt a relationship with food, my 
        body, and myself. I’ve learned that I am so much 
        more than a number on a scale or the size of my 
        jeans. I’ve discovered strength I didn’t know I had 
        and joy I thought I’d lost forever. Recovery is a 
        choice I make every single day, and it’s the most 
        important decision I’ll ever make.

        Life after anorexia isn’t just surviving—it’s thriving.
